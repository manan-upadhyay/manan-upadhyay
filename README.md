# Manan Upadhyay

Senior Full Stack Developer | AI-Augmented Engineer

I am a Senior Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience designing and
delivering scalable, production-grade web applications.

My primary expertise lies in **React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript**, and
modern system design with a strong focus on **architecture, performance
optimization, caching strategies, and maintainable codebases**.

I work as an **AI-augmented engineer**, using advanced AI agents
(GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini) to accelerate development,
refactor complex logic, validate edge cases, and generate technical
documentation — while retaining full ownership of engineering decisions and
production reliability.

## What I focus on

- Frontend architecture (component-driven, scalable UI systems)
- Backend APIs (Node.js, REST, authentication, RBAC)
- Performance optimization (React Query, caching, memoization, code splitting)
- Database design and query optimization (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Image optimization and Core Web Vitals
- Clean, readable, well-documented code
- AI-assisted development and documentation (used responsibly)

## About the repositories here

Most repositories in this profile are **personal or exploratory projects**.
Due to working in a service-based organization, **production client projects
cannot be open-sourced**.

These repositories are intended to demonstrate:
- Engineering approach and structure
- Code organization and readability
- Architectural thinking and trade-offs
- Frontend and backend patterns used in real-world systems
