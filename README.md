# Manan Upadhyay

Senior Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience designing and delivering
scalable, production-grade web applications.

I specialize in **React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js, TypeScript**, and modern system design
with a strong focus on **architecture, performance optimization, caching, and
maintainable codebases**.

I work as an **AI-augmented engineer**, using advanced AI agents
(GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini) to accelerate development,
refactor complex logic, validate edge cases, and keep technical documentation
aligned with code — while retaining full ownership of engineering decisions
and production reliability.

## What I focus on

- Frontend architecture (React, Next.js, component-driven systems)
- Backend APIs (Node.js, Express, Nest, REST, authentication, RBAC)
- Performance optimization (React Query, caching, memoization, code-splitting)
- Database design & query optimization (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Image optimization and Core Web Vitals
- Clean, well-documented, production-ready code
- AI-assisted development and documentation (used responsibly)
